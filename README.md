## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Docker and Docker Compose
*   Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  Clone the repository and its submodules:
    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/juannpz/realtime-sync-hub.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd realtime-sync-hub
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**

    Each service requires a `.env` file in its respective directory to function correctly. Create the files as described below.

    **A) CRUD Service (`./services/crud-service/.env`)**

    | Variable              | Description                                  | Example Value          |

4.  Start all services using Docker Compose. This will build the images and run the containers in detached mode.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

## Running the Services

Once the `docker-compose up` command is complete, the services will be running and available at their respective ports as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

*   **CRUD Service API:** `http://localhost:8000`
*   **WebSocket Service:** `ws://localhost:8080`

You can view the logs for all services by running:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

To stop the services, run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests for a specific service, navigate to its directory and execute the Deno test command.

```bash
# Example for crud-service
cd services/crud-service
deno test --allow-all
```
Repeat for any other service as needed.

## System Architecture: Real-Time Update Flow

This section describes the architecture and data flow of the real-time synchronization system. The process is best understood in two distinct phases: the initial connection and the subsequent data update flow.

### A. Initial WebSocket Connection Flow

Before any real-time updates can be received, each client must establish a persistent connection with the `WebSocket Connection Service`. This process, known as a "handshake," looks like this: [Show render](https://newmo-oss.github.io/mermaid-viewer/?sequence-number=0#eJxlkDFvwlAMhHd+xY1UNC2sGbJQVKYqaiIxvz7cYJHa6bND/j6CRAjBZtnn705n9N+TRPrg0KTwNwOALiTnyF0Qx7plEkewaXoS7Oin0ngkryidONJFetthrSIUnVUw3WdXwgjLimLx+J9jW9clPjc13gfD/PsS0Byu6LsmhT0h3qAvV9gjIsuKIhsdcqyWK1QDezywNCiTukZtDfNtkL0dwpFgfYxk9tu3I+9LnaAnSlPM1yeHHCUlY3O6b+AuGNggOkA7krczg6B7fA==)

    participant Client as Client
    participant WebSocketService as WebSocket Connection Service

    Client->>+WebSocketService: HTTP GET /ws (Request to upgrade connection)
    WebSocketService-->>-Client: 101 Switching Protocols (Handshake successful)
    Note over Client, WebSocketService: Persistent WebSocket connection is now open.
```

### B. Real-Time Data Update Flow

Once the connection is established, the system is ready to push updates. The components below work together to propagate a change from one user to another in real-time.

#### Core Components

1.  **CRUD Service (`crud-service`):** A REST API responsible for all Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the database. It is the entry point for any data modification.
2.  **Database Listener Service (`database-listener-service`):** A service that monitors the database for changes (inserts, updates, deletes). Upon detecting a change, it publishes a notification to a specific channel on the message broker.
3.  **WebSocket Connection Service (`websocket-connection-service`):** Manages persistent WebSocket connections with clients. It subscribes to notifications from the message broker and relays the change data to the corresponding clients through their WebSocket connection.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following diagram shows how a change made by `Client A` propagates through the system to `Client B`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor ClientA as Client A
    participant CRUDService as CRUD Service
    participant Database as Database
    participant DBListener as Database Listener Service
    participant Broker as Message Broker
    participant WebSocketService as WebSocket Connection Service
    actor ClientB as Client B

    Note over ClientA, ClientB: Both clients have an<br/>active WebSocket connection.

    ClientA->>+CRUDService: POST /api/v1/user (Create new user)
    CRUDService->>+Database: INSERT INTO users (...)
    Database-->>-CRUDService: Insertion Confirmation
    CRUDService-->>-ClientA: 201 Created

    Note right of Database: The change in the 'users' table<br/>is detected by the listener.

    DBListener->>+Database: Listening for changes (e.g., CDC, Triggers)
    Database-->>-DBListener: Change notification for 'users'

    DBListener->>+Broker: PUBLISH 'user_created', {data}
    Broker-->>-DBListener: Publish Confirmation

    Note left of WebSocketService: The service is subscribed<br/>to the Broker's events.

    WebSocketService->>+Broker: SUBSCRIBE 'user_created'
    Broker-->>-WebSocketService: Notification: 'user_created', {data}

    WebSocketService->>ClientB: Sends update via WebSocket
    Note over ClientB: The UI updates in<br/>real-time without a refresh.
```

#### Detailed Update Flow

The sequence diagram is explained by the following steps:

1.  **Data Modification:** **Client A** performs an action that modifies data by sending an HTTP request (e.g., `POST /api/v1/user`) to the **CRUD Service**.

2.  **Database Operation:** The **CRUD Service** processes the request and executes the corresponding operation in the **Database**.

3.  **Change Detection:** The **Database Listener Service**, which is constantly monitoring the database, detects the change instantly.

4.  **Notification Publishing:** The **Database Listener Service** publishes a message with details of the change to a specific channel on the **Message Broker**.

5.  **Subscription and Reception:** The **WebSocket Connection Service**, which is subscribed to that channel, receives the message from the broker.

6.  **Relaying to the Client:** The **WebSocket Connection Service** identifies which connected clients should receive this update and sends the data to **Client B** (and any other relevant clients) through their active WebSocket connection.

7.  **UI Update:** **Client B**'s application receives the data and dynamically updates the user interface in real-time.

### Conclusion

This decoupled architecture allows the system to be robust and scalable. Each service has a single responsibility, which simplifies maintenance and independent development. The use of a message broker as an intermediary ensures that the services are not directly dependent on each other, allowing notifications to be processed asynchronously and reliably.
